# My Cli tools

This repository contains all my custom CLI tools created to optimize my workflow.

So far, Iâ€™ve written two simple tools in Go to improve my work efficiency.
I originally started this project to learn about **Shebangs**, which are really cool!
It was first written in Node.js, but I got excited about Go and rewrote them.

List of tools:

1. **openrep:** It opens current working repo in your browser
2. **openpr:** It opense current PR (if any) into your brwoser

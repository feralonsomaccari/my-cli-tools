# My Cli tools

This repository contains all my custom CLI tools that I’ve created to optimize my workflow.

So far, I’ve written two simple tools in Node.js to learn about **Shebangs**, which are really cool!
More about **Shebangs:** https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)

I plan to rewrite these tools in **Go** or **C** soon.

List of tools:

1. **openrep:** It opens current working repo in your browser
2. **openpr:** It opense current PR (if any) into your brwoser

### How to Run

Just run the app using the Node interpreter, like node {app}, and it should work if Git is already initialized in your directory. However, I recommend adding it as a binary executable by creating a symbolic link, which is how I use my tools.

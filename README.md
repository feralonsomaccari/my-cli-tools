# My Cli tools

This repo contains all my cli tools I write to optimize my workflow.

So far I've written two simple tools in NodeJs because I wanted to learn about **Shebangs** which are really cool!

I'm planning to rewrite these in Go soon

List of tools:

1) **openrep:**  It opens current working repo in your browser
2) **openpr:** It opense current PR (if any) into your brwoser

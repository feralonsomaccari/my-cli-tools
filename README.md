# My Cli tools

This repo contains all my cli tools I write to optimize my workflow.

So far I've written two simple tools in NodeJs because I wanted to learn about *Shebang* which are really cool!

I'm planning to rewrite these in Go soon

List of tools:

1) *openrep:*  It opens current working repo in your browser
2) *openpr:* It opense current PR (if any) into your brwoser
